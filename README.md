# SudokuSolver

Basic implementation of a 9x9 Sudoku solver.

The solver takes a Sudoku given in input.txt and outputs the result to output.txt. Also optional to provide a sudoku in std::vector<std::vector<int>> form.

Currently there is no complex error handling. This is a basic implementation to test out C++ on VSCode Linux environment interfacing with GitHub.
